<p>sudo aptitude install nessus</p>
<p><strong>3) Nmap – The Network Mapper</strong></p>
<p>Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is a free and open source (license) utility for network exploration or security auditing. Many systems and network administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and both console and graphical versions are available.</p>
<p><strong>Install nmap ubuntu</strong></p>
<p>sudo aptitude install nmap</p>
<p>If you want nmap frontend install the following package</p>
<p>sudo aptitude install zenmap</p>

<li>files commonly created by rootkits;</li>
<li>executables with anomalous file permissions;</li>
<li>suspicious strings in kernel modules;</li>
<li>hidden files in system directories;</li>
</ul>
<p>and can optionally scan within files. Using rkhunter alone does not guarantee that a system is not compromised. Running additional tests, such as chkrootkit, is recommended.</p>
<p><strong>Install rkhunter in ubuntu</strong></p>
<p>sudo aptitude install rkhunter</p>
<p><strong>8) tiger – Report system security vulnerabilities</strong></p>
<p>TIGER, or the ‘tiger’ scripts, is a set of Bourne shell scripts, C programs and data files which are used to perform a security audit of UNIX systems.

<p>Many sniffing modes were implemented to give you a powerful and complete sniffing suite. It’s possible to sniff in four modes: IP Based, MAC Based, ARP Based (full-duplex) and PublicARP Based (half-duplex).<br>It has the ability to check whether you are in a switched LAN or not, and to use OS fingerprints (active or passive) to let you know the geometry of the LAN.</p>
<p><strong>Install ettercap in ubuntu</strong></p>
<p>sudo aptitude install ettercap</p>
<p>If you want to install ettercap GUI install following package</p>
<p>sudo aptitude install ettercap-gtk</p>
<p><strong>18) Netcat – TCP/IP swiss army knife</strong></p>
<p>A simple Unix utility which reads and writes data across network connections using TCP or UDP protocol. It is designed to be a reliable “back-end” tool that can be used directly or easily driven by other programs and scripts. At the same time it is a feature-rich network debugging and exploration tool, since it can create almost any kind of connection you would need and has several interesting built-in capabilities.<br><strong><br>Install netcat in ubuntu</strong></p>
<p>sudo aptitude install netcat</p>
<p><strong>19) MTR – mtr combines the functionality of the ‘traceroute’ and ‘ping’ programs in a single network diagnostic tool.</strong></p>
<p>As mtr starts, it investigates the network connection between the host mtr runs on and a user-specified destination host. After it determines the address of each network hop between the machines, it sends a sequence ICMP ECHO requests to each one to determine the quality of the link to each machine. As it does this, it prints running statistics about each machine.<br><strong><br>Install mtr in ubuntu</strong></p>
<p>Download .deb package from <a href="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/unstable/main/binary-i386/net/mtr_0.39-1.deb" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a></p>
<p>dpkg -i mtr_0.39-1.deb</p>
<p><strong>20) Hping3 – Active Network Smashing Tool</strong></p>
<p>hping3 is a network tool able to send custom ICMP/UDP/TCP packets and to display target replies like ping does with ICMP replies. It handles fragmentation and arbitrary packet body and size, and can be used to transfer files under supported protocols. Using hping3, you can test firewall rules, perform (spoofed) port scanning, test network performance using different protocols, do path MTU discovery, perform traceroute-like actions under different protocols, fingerprint remote operating systems, audit TCP/IP stacks, etc. hping3 is scriptable using the TCL language.</p>
<p><strong>Install hping3 in ubuntu</strong></p>
<p>sudo aptitude install hping3</p>
<p><strong>21) ngrep – grep for network traffic</strong></p>
<p>ngrep strives to provide most of GNU grep’s common features, applying them to the network layer. ngrep is a pcap-aware tool that will allow you to specify extended regular expressions to match against data payloads of packets. It currently recognizes TCP, UDP and ICMP across Ethernet, PPP, SLIP and null interfaces, and understands bpf filter logic in the same fashion as more common packet sniffing tools, such as tcpdump and snoop.</p>
<p><strong>Install ngrep in ubuntu</strong></p>
<p>sudo aptitude install ngrep</p>
<p><strong>22) john – active password cracking tool</strong></p>
<p>john, mostly known as John the Ripper, is a tool designed to help systems administrators to find weak (easy to guess or crack through brute force) passwords, and even automatically mail users warning them about it, if it is desired.<br>It can also be used with different cyphertext formats, including Unix’s DES and MD5, Kerberos AFS passwords, Windows’ LM hashes, BSDI’s extended DES, and OpenBSD’s Blowfish.</p>
<p><strong>Install john in ubuntu</strong></p>
<p>sudo aptitude install john</p>
<p><strong>23) tcptrace – Tool for analyzing tcpdump output</strong></p>
<p>Tcptrace is a tool for analyzing and reporting on tcpdump (or other libpcap) dump files. It can summarize the data or generate graph data for use with the gnuplot tool from the gnuplot package. Graph data can be created for throughput, RTT, time sequences, segment size, and cwin.</p>
<p><strong>Install tcptrace in ubuntu</strong></p>
<p>sudo aptitude install tcptrace</p>
<p><strong>24) netdude – NETwork DUmp data Displayer and Editor for tcpdump trace files</strong></p>
<p>It is a GUI-based tool that allows you to make detailed changes to packets in tcpdump trace files, in particular, it can currently do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set the value of any field in IP, TCP and UDP packet headers.</li>
<li>Copy, move and delete packets in the trace file.</li>
<li>Fragment and reassemble IP packets.</li>
<li>Netdude constantly communicates with a tcpdump process to update<br>the familiar tcpdump output that corresponds to the trace. This<br>also means that any changes made to your local version of tcpdump<br>are reflected in Netdude.</li>
<li>Plugin architecture: people can easily add plugins for specific<br>tasks. The code comes with a plugin for checksum correction in IP,<br>TCP and UDP, and a dummy plugin.</li>
<li>Through the plugin mechanism, Netdude provides a good facility for<br>writing tcpdump trace file filters.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Install netdude in ubuntu</strong></p>
<p>sudo aptitude install netdude</p>
<p><strong>25) tcpreplay – Tool to replay saved tcpdump files at arbitrary speeds</strong></p>
<p>Tcpreplay is aimed at testing the performance of a NIDS by replaying real background network traffic in which to hide attacks. Tcpreplay allows you to control the speed at which the traffic is replayed, and can replay arbitrary tcpdump traces. Unlike programmatically-generated artificial traffic which doesn’t exercise the application/protocol inspection that a NIDS performs, and doesn’t reproduce the real-world anomalies that appear on production networks (asymmetric routes, traffic bursts/lulls, fragmentation, retransmissions, etc.), tcpreplay allows for exact replication of real traffic seen on real networks.</p>
<p><strong>Install tcpreplay in ubuntu</strong></p>
<p>sudo aptitude install tcpreplay</p>
<p><strong>26) Dsniff – Various tools to sniff network traffic for cleartext insecurities</strong></p>
<p>This package contains several tools to listen to and create network traffic:</p>
<ul>
<li>arpspoof – Send out unrequested (and possibly forged) arp replies.</li>
<li>dnsspoof – forge replies to arbitrary DNS address / pointer queries<br>on the Local Area Network.</li>
<li>dsniff – password sniffer for several protocols.</li>
<li>filesnarf – saves selected files sniffed from NFS traffic.</li>
<li>macof – flood the local network with random MAC addresses.</li>
<li>mailsnarf – sniffs mail on the LAN and stores it in mbox format.</li>
<li>msgsnarf – record selected messages from different Instant Messengers.</li>
<li>sshmitm – SSH monkey-in-the-middle. proxies and sniffs SSH traffic.</li>
<li>sshow – SSH traffic analyser.</li>
<li>tcpkill – kills specified in-progress TCP connections.</li>
<li>tcpnice – slow down specified TCP connections via “active”<br>traffic shaping.</li>
<li>urlsnarf – output selected URLs sniffed from HTTP traffic in CLF.</li>
<li>webmitm – HTTP / HTTPS monkey-in-the-middle. transparently proxies.</li>
<li>webspy – sends URLs sniffed from a client to your local browser<br>(requires libx11-6 installed).<br><strong><br>Install dsniff ubuntu</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>sudo aptitude install dsniff</p>
<p><strong>27) scapy – Packet generator/sniffer and network scanner/discovery</strong></p>
<p>Scapy is a powerful interactive packet manipulation tool, packet generator, network scanner, network discovery, packet sniffer, etc. It can for the moment replace hping, 85% of nmap, arpspoof, arp-sk, arping, tcpdump, tethereal, p0f, ….<br>In scapy you define a set of packets, then it sends them, receives answers, matches requests with answers and returns a list of packet couples (request, answer) and a list of unmatched packets. This has the big advantage over tools like nmap or hping that an answer is not reduced to (open/closed/filtered), but is the whole packet.</p>
<p><strong>Install scapy in ubuntu</strong></p>
<p>sudo aptitude install scapy</p>
<p><strong>28) Ntop – display network usage in top-like format</strong></p>
<p>ntop is a Network Top program. It displays a summary of network usage by machines on your network in a format reminiscent of the unix top utility.It can also be run in web mode, which allows the display to be browsed with a web browser.</p>
<p><strong>Install ntop in ubuntu</strong></p>
<p>sudo aptitude install ntop</p>
<p><strong>29) NBTscan – A program for scanning networks for NetBIOS name information</strong></p>
<p>NBTscan is a program for scanning IP networks for NetBIOS name information. It sends NetBIOS status query to each address in supplied range and lists received information in human readable form. For each responded host it lists IP address, NetBIOS computer name, logged-in user name and MAC address (such as Ethernet).<br><strong><br>Install nbtscan in ubuntu</strong></p>
<p>sudo aptitude install nbtscan</p>
<p><strong>30) tripwire – file and directory integrity checker</strong></p>
<p>Tripwire is a tool that aids system administrators and users in monitoring a designated set of files for any changes. Used with system files on a regular (e.g., daily) basis, Tripwire can notify system administrators of corrupted or tampered files, so damage control measures can be taken in a timely manner.</p>
<p><strong>Install tripwire ubuntu</strong></p>
<p>sudo aptitude install tripwire</p>
